# Kata Starter Project for Java using IntelliJ and Maven

## Prerequisites

To be successful with this kata, you, the developer(s), should have IntelliJ CE (Community Edition) or better installed on your machine.

Java SE only needs to be installed if you plan on running your code outside of IntelliJ.

You should be familiar with Git and a git client: command line, IntelliJ, GitHub Desktop, or some other GUI tool.  Personally, I recommend the Eamcs Magit library, but only if you already know Emacs.

Basic understanding of GitHub or GitLab flow and an account on one or both of these platforms is also required.

If you feel weak in any of these areas, reach out to one of the facilitators or the organizer for some bootstrapping help.

## Setup Instructions

You, the developer(s) (meeting event attendees) should fork this starter project as the first step in solving the kata when using **IntelliJ** and **Maven**.

Fork the project to https://gitlab.com/boston-software-crafters/kata-solutions/kata-name/kotlin/project-name where *project-name* is chosen by the developer(s).

Once the project is forked, it must then be cloned to the developer(s) computer. You, the developer(s), can decide when to push your work.

This push/update must be done prior to switching pair/mob roles. We recommend that you push your final work if only to allow working on the kata after the meetup event.

The project name recommendations are based on the development style:

For a solo project, use the developer name or other identifying string, for example "pmr".

For a pair project, use some form that identifies each developer, for example "sam-paul".

For a mob project, use some arbitrary team name, for example "java-gurus"

Once the developer(s) are ready to start, do the following:

1) Verify the environment is ready by clicking on the green arrow in the file `src/test/java/org/bsc/katas/SolutionTest.java` on line 6.

This test should pass verifying that the environment is ready for a solution.

2) Add your first real test using the pattern from the test named `verify the developement environment works`

3) Each time you write enough test code to eliminate all compilation errors, re-run all the tests in the `SolutionTest` class.

For any and all tests that fail, fix the production solution in the file `src/main/kotlin/Solution.java`.

## Kata Instructions

Facilitators should add kata details here...

## Challenges [optional]

If you are already in the Internet Hall Of Fame and have finished this kata before everyone else has read the README.md file, then here are some challenges for you:

1) Make your solution clean, as in the principles and practices of Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin and his Clean Code world: use good names, short functions, good structure, SOLID code, etc.

Facilitator(s) should add additional challenges here, as appropriate.

## Solution Notes

Developer(s) should add notes here about the solution.
